Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the process of the design, development and maintenance of softwares that provide solutions.
It helps with automation of tasks and improved efficiency, thus increased productivity.
It provides tools and methods that help to solve complex problems in area like healthcare.
It also helps to promote economic growth by creating jobs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)There is object-oriented programming and design ->its concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, revolutionized software development
b)The Agile revolution -> Some agile methodologies like scrum and kanban emphasized iterative development nad responsiveness to change.
c)Cloud computing -> Cloud platforms have streamlined software development, scaling and maintenance 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning -> Defining the project scope, user requirements, objectives
Design -> Creating the system architecture with detailed specifications
Implementation -> Writing the code according to the design specifications
Testing -> Verifying the software's functionality and performance
Deployment -> Releasing the software to the end-users
Maintenance -> Debugging the software and providing updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall -> A sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next
             It emphasizes on detailed planning and Documentation first.
             Example: bulding a bridge where requirements are well defined
Agile methodology -> it is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility
                    Focuses on creating softwares in short cycles
                    Example: developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer ->Writes and tests code, designs and implements sotware solutions, Trouble shoots and debugs codes
Quality assurance designer -> Develops and executes test plans, identifies and reports software defects, ensures software quality and reliability
Project manager -> plans and manages project timelines and resources, Coordinates team activities and communication, ensures project deliverables meet requirements

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs -> Provide a comprehensive set of tools for software development, including code editors, debuggers, and build automation
        Enhance developer productivity and efficiency
        Example: Visual studio, Eclipse
VCS -> Track changes to code over time, enabling collaboration and preventing data loss
       Allow developers to revert to previous versions and manage code branches
      Github, GitLab 
        
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge -> Changing requirements
Strategy -> Embrace agile methodologies and prioritize communication
Challenge -> Communication issues
Strategy -> Establish clear communication channels and conduct regular meetings
Challenge -> Time constraints
Strategy -> Proper project planning, task prioritization and effective time management
Challenge -> Bugs and defects
Strategy -> rigorous testing and code reviews

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit -> Testing individual components of the software to ensure each unit performs its intended task correctly.
        It isolates and fixes bugs early in the development process.
Integration -> Testing the interaction between different modules and ensure they work together as expected.
               Identifies interface and communication problems
System -> Testing the entire software system as a whole.
          Validates the overall system behaviour 
Acceptance -> Testing the software form the end-users perspective
              Ensures that the system is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective instructions or questions to elicit desired responses from AI models
Importance: It helps to control the output that you get, it improves the accuracy of the responses and also enhances creativity in terms of crafting the prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague : Tell me about animals - animals is an extremely broad category
Improved: Describe the adaptations of arctic foxes that allows them to survive in extreme cold. Focus on their physical characteristics and behavioral patterns.
Why : The AI will provide information specifically about arctic fox adaptations, rather than the general overview of the animal kingdom.
